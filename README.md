# Bombaim
A Web tool to create backing tracks on your browser based on a given chord sequence and a selection of styles, instruments, timbres and tempo. Made with Flask + React, Bombaim will boost your music study, but can also serve as an accompaniment software if you want to generate backing tracks for a performance.
